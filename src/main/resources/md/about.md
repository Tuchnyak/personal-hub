# Welcome to My Personal Hub!

Hello there! I'm **George**{.highlight}, a backend **Java/Kotlin** developer, and a proud father of two. This is my digital space where I explore, build, and share my journey in the world of technology.

## About Me

Professionally, I'm driven by the challenge of crafting robust, scalable, and efficient backend solutions. Java and Kotlin are my primary tools, and I enjoy delving into architecture, clean code, and the intricate details of system development.

Before fully immersing myself in software development, I gained valuable experience as a design engineer, specializing in optical instruments for scientific and space projects. This background provided a unique perspective and a solid foundation in problem-solving and analytical thinking, which I apply to my coding endeavors today.

Outside of work, my family is my greatest joy. Being a father adds a wonderful dimension to my life and inspires my continuous learning and growth.
